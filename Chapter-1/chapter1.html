    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a cupcake tin with paper liners.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the milk, vegetable oil (or melted butter), eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined (do not overmix).</li>
        <li>Slowly mix in the hot water or brewed coffee to thin out the batter; it will be slightly runny.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners, filling each about 2/3 full.</li>
        <li>Place the tray in the preheated oven and bake for 18–22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let them sit in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, top with chocolate buttercream frosting, sprinkles, or any desired toppings.</li>
