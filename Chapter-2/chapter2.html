        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>In a world ruled by oppression and fear, The Hunger Games tells the gripping story of Katniss Everdeen, a courageous young woman from District 12 who is forced to take part in a brutal fight for survival. Panem, the world of the future consists of the wealthy Capitol, which controls twelve districts, each suffering under its harsh rule.
            As punishment for a past rebellion, the Capitol forces each district to send one boy and one girl as tributes to compete in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death where only one can survive. When her younger sister, Primrose Everdeen, is chosen as a tribute, Katniss bravely volunteers in her place, stepping into an arena where danger lurks at every turn.
            Alongside Peeta Mellark, the baker’s son with a mysterious connection to her, she navigates shifting alliances, unexpected betrayals and the ever-watchful eye of President Snow, the leader of Panem.
            But the Games are more than just survival. They are a spectacle, a reminder of the Capitol’s power and a tool to keep the districts in line.
            Filled with intense action, political intrigue and deep themes of resistance and sacrifice. The Hunger Games is more than just a fight for survival,it is a battle for freedom. Will Katniss be able to outlast the Games or will she become another pawn in the Capitol’s deadly game?
